# SP-Loop
## A robust and effienct loop closure detection approach for hybrid terrestrial and aerial vehicles (HyTAVs)

Our system is developed on the basis of the state-of-the-art [VINS-Fusion](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Fusion), which contains visual-inertial odometry (VINS-VIO), pose graph optimization (VINS-PGO), and loop closure detection (VINS-Loop). In this work, VINS-VIO and VINS-PGO are adopted, while our proposed loop closure detection approach is used to replace VINS-Loop to improve robustness against viewpoint changes. The flow diagram, illustrating three main stages and the pipeline, is shown as below:.

Firstly, keyframes from VINS-VIO are processed to extract the required descriptors. Secondly, a loop candidate is retrieved from the database based on the offline-trained visual vocabulary. Thirdly, the SuperGlue model is applied to find feature correspondences, which are then used in relative pose computation. Loop detection is finally predicted by examining the number of correspondences and the relative pose. 

**Features:**
- visual loop closure

## 1. Prerequisites
### 1.1 **Ubuntu** and **ROS**
Ubuntu 64-bit 18.04.
ROS Melodic. [ROS Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)


### 1.2. **Ceres Solver**
Follow [Ceres Installation](http://ceres-solver.org/installation.html).


## 2. Build VINS-Fusion
Clone the repository and catkin_make:
```
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Fusion.git
    cd ../
    catkin_make
    source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```
(if you fail in this step, try to find another computer with clean system or reinstall Ubuntu and ROS)

## 3. EuRoC Example
Download [EuRoC MAV Dataset](http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) to YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER. Take MH_01 for example, you can run VINS-Fusion with three sensor types (monocular camera + IMU, stereo cameras + IMU and stereo cameras). 
Open four terminals, run vins odometry, visual loop closure(optional), rviz and play the bag file respectively. 
Green path is VIO odometry; red path is odometry under visual loop closure.

### 3.1 Monocualr camera + IMU

```
    roslaunch vins vins_rviz.launch
    rosrun vins vins_node ~/catkin_ws/src/VINS-Fusion/config/euroc/euroc_mono_imu_config.yaml 
    (optional) rosrun loop_fusion loop_fusion_node ~/catkin_ws/src/VINS-Fusion/config/euroc/euroc_mono_imu_config.yaml 
    rosbag play YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER/MH_01_easy.bag
```

## 5. Data of a HyTAV
Download [car bag](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10t9H1u8pMGDOI6Q2w2uezEq5Ib-Z8tLz) to YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER.
Open four terminals, run vins odometry, visual loop closure(optional), rviz and play the bag file respectively. 
Green path is VIO odometry; red path is odometry under visual loop closure.
```
    roslaunch vins vins_rviz.launch
    rosrun vins vins_node ~/catkin_ws/src/VINS-Fusion/config/vi_car/vi_car.yaml 
    (optional) rosrun loop_fusion loop_fusion_node ~/catkin_ws/src/VINS-Fusion/config/vi_car/vi_car.yaml 
    rosbag play YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER/car.bag
```

## 6. Run with your devices 
VIO is not only a software algorithm, it heavily relies on hardware quality. For beginners, we recommend you to run VIO with professional equipment, which contains global shutter cameras and hardware synchronization.

### 6.1 Configuration file
Write a config file for your device. You can take config files of EuRoC and KITTI as the example. 


## 7. Docker Support
To further facilitate the building process, we add docker in our code. Docker environment is like a sandbox, thus makes our code environment-independent. To run with docker, first make sure [ros](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation) and [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) are installed on your machine. Then add your account to `docker` group by `sudo usermod -aG docker $YOUR_USER_NAME`. **Relaunch the terminal or logout and re-login if you get `Permission denied` error**, type:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/VINS-Fusion/docker
make build
```
Note that the docker building process may take a while depends on your network and machine. After VINS-Fusion successfully built, you can run vins estimator with script `run.sh`.
Script `run.sh` can take several flags and arguments. Flag `-k` means KITTI, `-l` represents loop fusion, and `-g` stands for global fusion. You can get the usage details by `./run.sh -h`. Here are some examples with this script:
```
# Euroc Monocualr camera + IMU
./run.sh ~/catkin_ws/src/VINS-Fusion/config/euroc/euroc_mono_imu_config.yaml

# Euroc Stereo cameras + IMU with loop fusion
./run.sh -l ~/catkin_ws/src/VINS-Fusion/config/euroc/euroc_mono_imu_config.yaml

# KITTI Odometry (Stereo)
./run.sh -k ~/catkin_ws/src/VINS-Fusion/config/kitti_odom/kitti_config00-02.yaml YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER/sequences/00/

# KITTI Odometry (Stereo) with loop fusion
./run.sh -kl ~/catkin_ws/src/VINS-Fusion/config/kitti_odom/kitti_config00-02.yaml YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER/sequences/00/

#  KITTI GPS Fusion (Stereo + GPS)
./run.sh -kg ~/catkin_ws/src/VINS-Fusion/config/kitti_raw/kitti_10_03_config.yaml YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER/2011_10_03_drive_0027_sync/

```
In Euroc cases, you need open another terminal and play your bag file. If you need modify the code, simply re-run `./run.sh` with proper auguments after your changes.
